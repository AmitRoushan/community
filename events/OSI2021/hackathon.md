# SODA Hackathon @ OSI 2021
The SODA Hackathon 2021 is an initiative to familiarize and encourage people to contribute to Open Source Development, whether by fixing bugs, creating new features, or updating and writing documentation of core SODA Projects.


You will be working on core SODA Projects and you can contribute to these projects on Github by submitting Pull Requests (PR) or raising issues. For every PR and issue that is accepted, we will calculate the impact of the contribution by analyzing the scope of the work done.

The issues will be of varied difficulty levels right from beginner level. This is so that everyone can  participate, irrespective of their experience with open source. 

The participants contributing will be eligible to win the prizes listed below. Participants will also have to perform a few other tasks which will be shared via email on successfully registering for the hackathon.

**Note**: Every participant must have their own GitHub ID and use the same for contributions.

If you are new to open source (which everyone was once!), you can take a look at the [Introduction to Open Source](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/an-introduction-to-open-source) tutorial series. To make your first contribution, it’s required to familiarize yourself with how to create a pull request.
