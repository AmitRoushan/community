# Project Ideas List

## 1 : Serve my metdata!
*Metadata Server with Basic APIs for Data Lake solution*

**Project Type: Development**

**Project Description:**

Develop a metadata management server with REST APIs for basic CRUD(Create/Read/Update/Delete) operation. Need to have a metadata data base

## 2 : Search! Search! Search Engine!
*Build a simple search engine with specific performance indicators*

**Project Type: Development**

**Project Description:**

Develop a search engine using existing or new search algorithms for metadata search. It is targeted for a data lake solution.

## 3 : Where is my cache?!
*Developing a cache engine for improving the performance for data lake*

**Project Type: Development**

**Project Description:**

Develop a cache engine using existing tools/cache solutions(like redis) or new ideas. Showcase the performance indicators of the solution especially for metadata management.

 ## 4 : Monit Now!
*Performance Monitoring for Storage in Kubernetes*

**Project Type : Porting and Enhancement**

**Project Description:**

We have the existing project for storage monitoring at [https://github.com/sodafoundation/delfin](https://github.com/sodafoundation/delfin). Need to port the same for Kubernetes (some working PoC is already available). We need to build native kubernetes APIs through CRDs and controllers.

 ## 5 : Hi AI!
*Build Intelligent Insights*

**Project Type : Development and Enhancement**

**Project Description:**

We have the existing project for storage monitoring at [https://github.com/sodafoundation/delfin](https://github.com/sodafoundation/delfin). It has interfaces to get all the resource, alert and performance monitoring data. You need to apply AI algorithms (existing or new) to do predictive analysis on the monitoring data to provide deeper insights.

## 6 : Let me port it!
Port Delfin to different Operating Systems

**Project Type : Porting**

**Project Description:**

We have the existing project for storage monitoring at [https://github.com/sodafoundation/delfin](https://github.com/sodafoundation/delfin). It is supported on Ubuntu versions. We would like you to port this to CentOS, Redhat and Windows.

 ## 7: Show off the data!
*Custom visualization for Monitoring data*

**Project Type : Visualization Development**

**Project Description:**

We have the existing project for storage monitoring at [https://github.com/sodafoundation/delfin](https://github.com/sodafoundation/delfin). It supports a basic dashboard based on prometheus and grafana. You can build custom visualization using custom visualization profiles to provide useful insights and representation of the data. As we have resource, alert and performance data from various storage vendors and models, providing a comprehensive visualization will very useful for users.

 ## 8: Store with Containers
*Integrate more Container Storage plugins for Kubernetes in SODA CSI*

**Project Type : Integration/Development**

**Project Description:**

 SODA CSI(Container Storage Interface) is a typical CSI plugin which supports multiple vanilla CSI plugins. You need to integrate and qualify more CSI plugins to SODACSI. You can also provide enhancement to SODACSI, especially to manage multiple CSI plugins and provide consolidated health and other information about it

## 9: So much data, So Many Clouds..
*Data migration workflows development and automation*

**Project Type : Development**

**Project Description:**

We have a multi-cloud project [https://github.com/sodafoundation/multi-cloud](https://github.com/sodafoundation/multi-cloud) which can work across different cloud vendors through a unified API interface. It also supports data migration and lifecycle management features. You need to build custom workflows and automation policies for data movement from one cloud to another. The policy can be modified by the user based on the needs and schedule. So scheduling and policy management operations to be supported along with role based access.

 ## 10: Archive Smartly
*Hybrid Smart Archival Solution across Edge and Cloud*

**Project Type : Enhancement / Development**

**Project Description:**

We have a multi-cloud project [https://github.com/sodafoundation/multi-cloud](https://github.com/sodafoundation/multi-cloud) which can work across different cloud vendors through a unified API interface. It supports basic data archival from on premise to cloud. Utilizing these existing features, we need to build data archival with more intelligence with custom policies and scheduling. Needs to be fully automated. Along with this, we need to provide the archival solution to do data archival from Edge location to any supported cloud.
