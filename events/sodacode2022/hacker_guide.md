What more, you can win amazing prizes worth USD6000+, contribution badges and  certifications. Selected participants will get a chance to share their experience and  showcase their code in our final gala event of SODACODE 2022 with a large open  source community of members and experts across the world.

A. We encourage all community members to contribute. If they are active contributors or maintainers of participating project(s) they can contribute to all the other projects, except the one where they are already contributors / maintainers. 
**Note**: Participating projects' PLs,  evaluation team members and SODACODE2022 organizing team members cannot participate in the hackathon.

A. Yes. If you register for SODACODE2022 as a hacker then you can attend Demo Days using the same ID.

**Q. Any prerequisites to participate in this challenge?**

A. All participants must have a GitHub ID and have basic understanding of working with Github and Git. If you are new to open source (which everyone was once!), you can take a look at the [Introduction to Open Source](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/an-introduction-to-open-source) tutorial series. To make your first contribution, it's required to familiarise yourself with how to create a pull request.

More team members working on the same issue will let you finish the work faster and pick up another issue to work on.

**Q. Can multiple teams collaborate for a single issue?**

A. If an issue requires lots of work to fix and the project leaders break down the issue into multiple tasks, or if the issue already has multiple tasks, different teams can raise PRs and associate it to the corresponding task in the issue. Points will be assigned to the PRs that are accepted.
