-   Please watch out for all the review comments on your PRs and fix them on time.

-   PRs which are marked accepted / approved by the maintainers will get the points according to the priority of the issue.

-   All PRs must be raised to the target branch specified by the project leaders in the respective repositories. If no target branch is specified then the PR can be raised to the main / master branch.

-   In case of multiple participants submitting PRs for the same issue, all the  PRs accepted / approved will get the points. Usually the maintainers will approve only the first best solution. Maintainers' review decision will be final.

-   You can also raise issues by testing any of the features of the listed projects. You need to raise the issues in the respective project github issues.

-   For issues that are raised, on any of the projects, MUST HAVE #SODACODE2022 remark in the description of the issue that you raise.

-   The maintainers will review the issues and mark it accepted or not, along with `SODACODE2022` label and the priority label as `SODATESTHIGH`, `SODATESTMED` or `SODATESTLOW`. Based on this priority you will be awarded the points.

-   Hackers can also attempt to solve the accepted issues raised by other hackers. (Which will be marked as `SODATESTHIGH` / `SODATESTMED` / `SODATESTLOW`). The procedure of contribution is the same as other issues.

-   Participants must make sure that they submit their Github username in the registration form, so that their contributions can be recorded.

-   If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will NOT be counted toward your participation in SODACODE2022.
